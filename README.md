This app acts as a pomodoro clock, iterating through adjustable working and break times. User stories given as guidelines for this project are: 

1. I can start a 25 minute pomodoro, and the timer will go off once 25 minutes has elapsed.
2. I can reset the clock for my next pomodoro.
3. I can cutomize the length of each pomodoro.
